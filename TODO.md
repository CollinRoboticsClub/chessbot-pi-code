TODO Right Now - 4/25/24 overnight - josh ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

- Arm code
  - PCA9685 to Pi - using python, perhaps... might be quick

- Drive code
  - SquareDrive class
    - uses existing Motor class

- Make a TESTING ROUTINES .MD ! ! !
  - Drive
    - Instructions for us to ensure pins are set correctly
    - Instructions for directional testing of each motor once pin mapping is good
  - Arm
    - Same old pinout check (way easier though)
    - Instructions to test arm directions and switch them incrementally



# What if we make it run some autonomous demos for Friday...?
Just for HARDWARE proof that it can run off that???
This might mean NOT using the WebUI

In theory, nice to have:
  - AIMING, which needs:
    - webcam access, ideally streaming the opencv output to the webserver
      - consider... CameraServer??? https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/wpilibpi/using-cameraserver.html
    - a PID controller or other motion controller to point the drivetrain at that spot
      - not impossible... but takes *LOTS of time!*
