# Robot stuff

Built off of our earlier robot arm project. The source code for that is [here](https://github.com/CollinRoboticsClub/robot-arm-2024).

TODO: finish readme

Notes:

- web ui is NOT built to handle concurrent access, so only have one person connected
  at a time. I'm not sure exactly what will happen, but I know a few things
  will break.
